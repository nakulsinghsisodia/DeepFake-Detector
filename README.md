# DeepFake Detector - AI/ML-Based Deepfake Detection Prototype  

## Overview  
[DeepFake Detector](https://github.com/nakulsinghsisodia/DeepFake-Detector) is a **prototype** AI/ML-based deepfake detection system that analyzes media files (images, videos, and audio) to identify synthetic or manipulated content. It detects deepfakes by analyzing patterns, inconsistencies, and artifacts in media files.  

## Features  
- âœ… **Real-time deepfake detection** for social media platforms  
- âœ… **API integration** for third-party applications  
- âœ… **Confidence scoring system** to evaluate authenticity  

## Installation & Setup  

### Prerequisites  
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:  
- **Node.js** (Latest LTS version recommended)  
- **Git** (To clone the repository)  

### Install Dependencies  
Run the following command to install the required dependencies:  
```bash
npm install
```

### Run the Development Server  
Start the development server using:  
```bash
npm run dev
```  
The project will now be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) or another available port.  

## Usage  
- **Upload an image, video, or audio file** to analyze.  
- The system will process the file and **detect deepfake elements**.  
- A **confidence score** will be displayed, indicating the likelihood of manipulation.  

## Note  
ðŸš€ This is a **prototype** and is still under development. Accuracy, speed, and real-world applicability will improve with further optimizations.
